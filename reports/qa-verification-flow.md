# WRPA 2.0 QA Verification Flow ✅

_Revision: v2.1.0-alpha | Phase: Verification-First Flow | Date: 2025-10-20_

---

## 1️⃣ Overview

This QA confirms that the **email verification-first flow** is now fully operational in WRPA 2.0.

**Goal:**  
Ensure users cannot access premium content or dashboard before verifying their email, and that the post-verification journey redirects correctly to the custom Wisdom Rain Dashboard.

## 2️⃣ Test Summary

| Step | Expected | Result |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **Sign-up form submission** | Redirects to `/verify-required/` | ✅ PASS |
| **Verification email delivery** | Instant transactional email | ✅ PASS |
| **Verify button click** | Link opens `/verify-email/?wrpa-verify=1&uid=...` | ✅ PASS |
| **Token validation** | HMAC-based validation, secure | ✅ PASS |
| **Redirect after verify** | Lands on `/wisdom-rain-dashboard/?wrpa-verify-status=success` | ✅ PASS |
| **Welcome email** | Sent right after successful verification | ✅ PASS |
| **Theme redirect override (Kallyas)** | Neutralized — no interference | ✅ PASS |
| **Resend verification (verify-required)** | Works, 2-min rate limited | ✅ PASS |

## 3️⃣ Observations & Notes

- ✅ The full verification pipeline (Access → Email → Verify) is stable.  
- ✅ `site_url()` + early `init` redirect permanently solved the Kallyas theme conflict.  
- ✅ `/verify-required/` page UX confirmed functional and visible post-signup.  
- ⚙️ Future consideration: localize status messages (`?wrpa-verify-status=success|error`) for front-end notice banners.  
- 🧩 DB inspection shows proper `wrpa_email_verified=1` flag assignment post-verification.  
- 💌 Both transactional and follow-up welcome emails validated via Gmail test inbox.
