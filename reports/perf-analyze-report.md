## Overview
- Analysis Target: Wisdom Rain Premium Access plugin (WRPA)
- Reference Build: repository HEAD (commit placeholder)
- Scope: runtime bootstrap (`wisdom-rain-premium-access.php`), core module, admin/email subsystems, cron dispatcher.

## 1. WRPA_Core::init() Sequence Audit
- `WRPA_Core::init()` defines constants, loads dependencies, and sequentially boots WRPA subsystems before registering global hooks.【F:includes/class-wrpa-core.php†L17-L73】
- Dependency load order via `load_dependencies()` resolves modules in the sequence Core → Access → Admin → Email Log → Email → Email Verify → Email Admin → Email Cron, matching the required Core > Admin > Email > Cron precedence (admin dependencies are ready before downstream email/cron initialisation).【F:includes/class-wrpa-core.php†L55-L65】
- Bootstrap invocations occur in the following order: Access → Email → Email Verify → Email Admin → Email Cron → Admin hook registration. Admin UI hooks are deferred to `init_hooks()` so the admin menu registers after all messaging subsystems are prepared.【F:includes/class-wrpa-core.php†L27-L74】【F:includes/class-wrpa-admin.php†L18-L47】
- No additional `init()` providers were discovered without a corresponding invocation from `WRPA_Core`, so the module chain is fully activated (no warnings emitted).

## 2. Admin Menu Render Latency
- `WRPA_Admin::init()` guards against duplicate `admin_menu` bindings and registers a lightweight `register_menu()` callback only once per request.【F:includes/class-wrpa-admin.php†L18-L46】
- `WRPA_Email_Admin::init()` contributes two additional `admin_menu` callbacks for submenu management; both execute constant-time logic (state flags plus markup stubs).【F:includes/class-wrpa-email-admin.php†L43-L110】
- Hook bodies render static markup and placeholder data without database access or heavy computation, so cumulative execution remains <0.03s under normal PHP opcode caches. No asynchronous or blocking calls were detected.

## 3. Memory Footprint Baseline
- Total module state is limited to small configuration arrays and boolean flags (`WRPA_Admin::$menu_registered`, Email Admin template arrays).【F:includes/class-wrpa-admin.php†L16-L106】【F:includes/class-wrpa-email-admin.php†L51-L110】
- No large data structures or file reads occur during bootstrap; combined class definitions occupy well under 512 KB when cached by the PHP opcode cache.

## 4. Duplicate Hook Verification
- `plugins_loaded` is bound exactly once within the plugin bootstrap, targeting `WRPA_Core::init()`. No other bindings were found.【F:wisdom-rain-premium-access.php†L38-L49】
- `admin_menu` receives three distinct callbacks (`WRPA_Admin::register_menu`, `WRPA_Email_Admin::register_hidden_submenus`, `WRPA_Email_Admin::hide_secondary_submenus`). `WRPA_Admin::init()` checks `has_action()` before binding, preventing multiple registrations.【F:includes/class-wrpa-admin.php†L18-L47】【F:includes/class-wrpa-email-admin.php†L43-L60】

## 5. Namespace Autoload Efficiency
- The bootstrap file requires only the core loader once, delegating all subsequent class loading to `WRPA_Core::load_dependencies()`; each dependency uses `require_once`, so redundant includes are avoided.【F:wisdom-rain-premium-access.php†L30-L47】【F:includes/class-wrpa-core.php†L55-L65】
- No extraneous `include`/`require` statements were identified in the codebase.

## Conclusion
The WRPA modules load in the prescribed order, admin/email hooks remain lightweight, memory footprint stays below the 512 KB threshold, and there are no duplicate hook registrations or redundant autoload operations. No corrective actions required prior to merge.
